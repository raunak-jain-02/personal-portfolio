# This is a Sample README for now.
Raunak Jain — Portfolio

This is a small static portfolio built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to be easy to edit and deploy.

Files
- `index.html` — main site markup
- `css/style.css` — styles and responsive layout
- `js/main.js` — small interactions (mobile nav, smooth scroll, theme toggle)
- `assets/` — images and static assets (replace `profile.svg` with your photo)

Run locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser (quick but some features like smooth scroll still work).
2. Or run a local static server (recommended). In Windows PowerShell, from the project root:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push the repo and enable Pages from the repository settings.
- Netlify / Vercel: drag-and-drop the folder or connect your git repo for continuous deploys.

Editing
- Replace `assets/profile.svg` with a real image named `profile.jpg` or adjust the `index.html` path.
- Update the `Projects` section in `index.html` with links and descriptions.
- Styles are in `css/style.css`. If you prefer a utility framework later, I can convert it to Tailwind.

Next steps you might want me to do
- Add a contact form using a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms).
- Create a light/dark theme switch (already scaffolded in JS) and add animations.
- Convert to a small React or Next.js site for dynamic content.
